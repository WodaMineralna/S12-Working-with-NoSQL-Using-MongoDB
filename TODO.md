# TODOs

This file tracks pending work and improvements for this project.  
Each item will be checked off as itâ€™s implemented.

## High Priority
[X] Set up docker-compose file  
[X] Update README  
[-] Add checkout validation / snapshot for cart items (check if product data changed and if product data in cart.items array is outdated)  
> Note: this functionality will be implemented in the future, as it would really shift from the courses path, and I want to focus on completing the course ASAP

[x] Update / remove test-db.cjs  

## Medium Priority
